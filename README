Cucapp is an interface between Cucumber and Cappuccino.

The Cappuccino application is served via thin and a small piece of code is injected.
This code connects back to your Cucumber script via AJAX requests

Have a look at the example application to see how to set things up.

This code is based heavily on Brominet (see http://github.com/textarcana/brominet)
